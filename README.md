# Creational Design Patterns
Creational - Design Patterns

## -Singleton

We define a class and provide one instance. You can use it everywhere in your application. Because this type instance is global access.

## -Prototype

We define an interface for a clone object. If we need to use this instance, all of the instances have a "clone()" function. This pattern provides us with new instances.

## -Builder

Java already has these types of Builders. We define a Builder Class to produce a new Class. ".build()" function generally returns a new instance.

## -Factory

Factory Pattern says that class should have an instance decisioner. It decides which instance will define in this class.

## -Abstract Factory

The difference between Factory and Abstract Factory are abstractFactory method, factoryCreator. You can use the abstract factory generic class.
